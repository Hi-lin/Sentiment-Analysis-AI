# Sentiment-Analysis-AI
## Description
### In this guided project, I used the pretrained google text classification AI, "Bert", and a recurrent neural network to analyze whether a tweet was positive or negative. In our final result, we are able to detect the sentiment of various messages with almost a 97% accuracy.
## Technologies Used
### Java
### recurrent neural network
### Natural Language Processing in AI
## What I learned
### I learned how to properly use a recurrent neural network to analyze sentences of different lengths.
### I learned the importance of transfer learning using powerful pretrained models (Bert and VGG16).
### I learned how to troubleshoot for overfitting and otehr errors.
### I learned how to use keras and tensorflow to train a model in python.
